# [**Setting Expectations About Linux: Part 1 - Software**](https://matchingbrackets.substack.com/p/setting-expectations-about-linux)

***In Part One of our "Setting Expectations About Linux" Series, we talk about using software on Linux. A lot of new-to-Linux users are shocked that we don't use the same software as everybody else.***

One of the biggest shocks people experience when trying Linux is assuming it works exactly like Windows or macOS - just with a different logo.

It’s not. It’s so not. Linux is a completely different animal.

I’ve seen this shock first-hand when I was working at Apple in 2006. Windows users would look into the Mac for the first time, and they would be shocked to see something different from what they were used to when purchasing and dealing with a Windows computer. But at least there was a version of Microsoft Office written for the Mac. Let me explain…

## The Biggest Shock: No Microsoft Office

There’s no doubt, Microsoft Office is one of the most popular office suites available in the world today. So you would think that Microsoft would want to make it available for all computer systems. But unfortunately, that’s not the case.

There is **no native Microsoft Office** for Linux. There is no **Word**, **Excel**, **PowerPoint**, or **Outlook** for Linux at all. It’s true.

Many people have to deal with the struggle with the fact that, on one hand, they want to learn and explore with Linux. But they’re forced to continue to use their Windows computers simply to run Microsoft Office.

But that doesn’t mean that the Linux world doesn’t create Documents, Spreadsheets, and Presentations. We have our own Linux equivalents that take care of our needs just fine.

The Linux app equivalents are certainly **compatible**, just not **identical**.

Now, you’ll see where people will try to rig up Microsoft Office and other titles to work natively on Linux. And while their efforts are commendable, it’s not ever a good experience.

The other option is to either run Windows in a virtual machine, or to use the web versions of Microsoft Office. And while you certainly could do that, I think that by doing this kind of defeats the entire notion of switching over to Linux in the first place.

My advice, would to be taking your time and try to get used to the Linux equivalents. I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised once you get used to them.

It’s funny to think about it, but there was a time when I couldn’t stand using LibreOffice at all. I hated it. But after using it over the years, it’s my go-to software for most everything I do. I literally use it every day. Now, I feel the same way about Microsoft Office as I once did about Linux.

But I’m getting ahead of myself. Let me introduce…

## Introducing: LibreOffice

One software suite that is very popular is called [**LibreOffice**](https://www.libreoffice.org/). LibreOffice includes a **word processing** app called **“Writer,”** a **spreadsheet** app called **“Calc,”** and a **presentation maker** called **“Impress.”**

But that’s not all. You also get a **drawing** app called **“Draw,”** an **equation editor** called **“Math,”** and a **database** much like Access called **“Base.”**

## Introfuving: OnlyOffice

I think Microsoft Office users might like [**OnlyOffice**](https://www.onlyoffice.com/) at first glance because it looks a lot like what you’re used to with Microsoft Office. It includes a **word processor**, **spreadsheet**, **presentation maker**, and a fillable **PDF** creator and reader.

But with OnlyOffice, you can run it on your own server on your own network and make it available for collaboration.

## Download them for free right NOW!

These aren’t the only two options for office software available on Linux. There are many more titles available for you to explore and see which one you like the best.

But not only is [**LibreOffice**](https://www.libreoffice.org/) and [**OnlyOffice**](https://www.onlyoffice.com/) available for Linux, but it’s also available - ***for free, by the way*** - for Windows and Mac. So, you can evaluate these two titles on your Windows and Mac computers and try them out for yourselves without making the switch to Linux.

## Another Shock: No Adobe Cerative Suite

I can just about hear what you’re saying, “Aw! C’mon, Joe. No Adobe Creative Suite, either!” I know. But it’s absolutely true. There is no **Photoshop**, **Illustrator**, **InDesign**, or **Premiere Pro**. But I think you know where I’m going to go here.

While there have been attempts to make a square peg fit into a round hole - or make the Adobe Suite work on Linux, the same iffy experience is the result.

But that doesn’t mean that professional designers, photographers, and video editors can’t use Linux at all. Again, compatible, just not identical.

You might enjoy:

- [**GIMP**](https://www.gimp.org/) is a great alternative to Photoshop for image editing. GIMP has been around for 20+ years and it’s getting better all the time.

- [**Krita**](https://krita.org/en/) is a great alternative to Photoshop’s image creation ability and alternative to Corel Painter.

- [**Inkscape**](https://inkscape.org/) is a powerful vector image creation tool and a great alterative to Adobe’s Illustrator.

- And video editors like [**Kdenlive**](https://kdenlive.org/) and [**DaVinci Resolve**](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve) are great alternatives to Adobe’s Premiere Pro.

And again, you can download **GIMP**, **Krita**, **Inkscape**, **Kdenlive**, **DaVinci Resolve** for Windows and Mac to evaluate without having to make the switch to Linux. They’re all free, so what do you have to lose?

They might not behave exactly like their equivalent Adobe apps, but they can result in the same filetype output.

## Software is Installed Differently... but the same

Yeah, that title is a little confusing. Let me explain…

On Windows and Mac, you download software in two ways:

**DOWNLOADING FROM THE WEBSITE**: Sometimes to download the software, first, you would go to the software’s website, and click on the big “DOWNLOAD” button. Then your software would download, and then you would install the software to your computer.


**DOWNLOAD FROM THE SOFTWARE STORE**: And other times to download software, you would open your “Software Store” that comes on your system. Do a search for the software you’re looking for, and download the software. Updates to the software you downloaded would come through the “Software Store.”

This is how it’s done on Windows, Mac…**AND LINUX**. And on Linux, you certainly can use the Terminal to type in the code to download the software if you want, but it’s not necessary to do this unless the “Software Center” on your Linux distro isn’t working properly. While you don’t need to download software through the Terminal, it’s certainly a good thing to know.

It’s like knowing how to drive an automatic automobile as well knowing how to drive with a manual.

Not only do you have many ways to download software, but you actually have a choice of different types of applications - each with their own features and benefits that may be of interest to you. But more on this later.

## So... is Linux The Wrong Choice?

That’s going to be something that you’re going to have to decide for yourself. I’m not going to be able to answer that. Only you can answer that for yourself.

You may be completely comfortable with Windows or Mac, and that’s perfectly fine. You use whatever you feel the most comfortable using. That’s the system for you. But something led you to learning more about Linux. Something piqued your curiosity.

Whatever choice you make, I hope you can get enough information to make an educated decision.

Well, I’m certainly glad you did get curious about Linux. Because maybe that led you to this article, and maybe that led you to Matching Brackets, and maybe you decided to join our mailing list, or subscribed to our YouTube channel. I sincerely hope that you find Matching Brackets a valuable resource for Linux.
