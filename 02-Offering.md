# 2. What I Make (Offerings)
Describe what you create today and what you might create later.

## Lead Posts:

Lead posts are small posts made on platforms that use these short posts to communicate to the public. These posts could act as notifications to existing members, or as lead generators to new members. 

Lead Posts are made on [**Bluesky**](https://bsky.app/profile/matchingbrackeets.bsky.social), [**Mastodon**](https://techhub.social/@matchingbrackets), & on [**Substack (Notes)**](https://substack.com/home). 

## Videos:

When a new video is released, a link to that video will be shared on all the other platforms. 

Videos are made and hosted on [**YouTube**](https://www.youtube.com/@MatchingBrackets).

## Printed Materials:

**FUTURE ITEM**: I plan on also releasing low-cost printed materials. These can be in the form of white papers, booklets, or electronic or printed books.

Apparently, Substack will allow me to sell these printed materials through their website, but I wonder how well people succeed there. I might just use Amazon...?

## Newsletters:

**FUTURE ITEM**: Apparently, Substack also allows readers to subscribe to a newsletter of when their favorite writers release something new. Right now, I release everything for free, and use Substack for donations. 

Draft: 12/23/2025
