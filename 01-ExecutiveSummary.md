# 1. Executive Summary 

What I'm building, who is it for, and why it matters. The instructions told me to write this all in one sentence, But with so many diversve topics, I thought I would be more detailed and offered this jojn

## Linux

I'm showing new users how they can use Linux themselves. I'm building a resource for Linux users to reference at anytime. I'm exploring Linux for myself and challenging myself to learn new things.

## Front-End Web Development

I'm showing my interests in front-end web development. I'm simply coding, and the viewers can watch and code along on their projects.

## Online Scammers

In order to bring awareness to this pheonomenon, I want to show people ads that wind up being scams. How they work and how they can be avoided. I would like to partner with the scammer community on YouTube, but what I will probably wind up doing is writing and releasing a book.

## Books

I plan on writing and selling books at a relatively cheap price. They could be for Linux, Front-end Web Development, or online scammers. 

## Why This Matters

**MICROSOFT**: Microsoft seems to be forcing some really invasive updates. Not only that, these updates are affecting those who own and use the previous version of Windows. People aren't happy with that, so they're looking to LInux for the first time. 

Essentially what Microsoft is doing is saying "Upgrade, or else." Buy a new computer if it doesn't meet our reqirements.

**ONLINE SCAMMERS**: I'm also showing my viewers some of the ads people are getting to try to scam them. With the hopes that the more we go over these kinds of ads, the easier it is for scam emails can be recognized more readily than what they are.

The more people are exposed to the ads that they receive, the better they'll be prepared in getting rid of the scam.

**FRONT-END WEB DEVELOPMENT**: I'm showing that it's possible to do front-end web depenloment on Linux. 

You can do *anything* on Linux.
